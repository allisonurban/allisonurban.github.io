Once upon a time I studied Digital and Experimental Media Art at the University of Washington where I made short films and installations.

After college I transitioned from the liberal arts to the tech industry by teaching myself web development, data analysis and software engineering.

I currently work as a Software Developer at MailChimp in Atlanta, Georgia.
